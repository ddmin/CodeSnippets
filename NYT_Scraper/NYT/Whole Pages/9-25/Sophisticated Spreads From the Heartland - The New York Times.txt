Title: Sophisticated Spreads From the Heartland - The New York Times

By Florence Fabricant

For some time now, La Quercia, the cured meat company in Norwalk, Iowa, has been selling its version of ’nduja, a spicy spreadable proscuitto popular in Calabria in Southern Italy. Now it has added two more similar concoctions: ground pancetta and pesto bianco made with seasoned lardo (pork fat). They’re great to keep on hand for sandwiches and hors d’oeuvre spreads.

La Quercia’s four-ounce tubes of pesto bianco (lardo), ground pancetta and ’nduja are $7 each until the end of the month, $9.80 after that, at Eataly; and $39.99 for three tubes, mondofood.com.

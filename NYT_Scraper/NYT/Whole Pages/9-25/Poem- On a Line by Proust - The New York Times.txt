Title: Poem: On a Line by Proust - The New York Times

By Adam Giannelli

The villanelle (Italian for “rustic”) is a pastoral song whose recurring lines and interlocking rhyme scheme create the ideal vehicle for Adam Giannelli’s paean to the past. According to this lament, we can never truly go home again, not even in our minds. Just as gardens wither and beloved figures depart into memory, so do the poem’s rhymes: The ingenious pairing of “paradises/irises” devolves into “chives/apse,” while the pure trinity of “host/toast/ghost” dwindles to “tallest/Eucharist/Julius/Proust.” Eventually we’re left with the villanelle’s twinned refrain — until even these wisps of sound recede.

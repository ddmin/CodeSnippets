Title: Pot and Strainer All in One - The New York Times

By Florence Fabricant

This roomy new pot has rows of holes in the lid, which locks in place, so the cook can drain liquid while keeping the food, like vegetables or pasta, in the vessel. At five and a half quarts, it’s big enough to accommodate long pasta like linguine. The interior of the hard anodized aluminum pot is nonstick, as is the exterior. Why would one need a nonstick exterior, you may wonder? If you’re a fanatic like me when it comes to having the outside surfaces of my cookware spanking clean, you’d welcome it. The pot can be used on induction burners and in the oven up to 400 degrees.

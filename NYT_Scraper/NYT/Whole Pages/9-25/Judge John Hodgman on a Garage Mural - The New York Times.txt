Title: Judge John Hodgman on a Garage Mural - The New York Times

By John Hodgman

Toni writes: My sister wants my help painting an elaborate mural in her garage: a geometric pattern that is popular on Pinterest. I think this is unnecessary. I, however, could use help repainting my kitchen. Basically I think she has too much time on her hands and I don’t make a lot of money. She should help me.

You are correct: A garage mural is always unnecessary for, as per Kant, the aesthetic is that which is beautiful in design but serves no practical function (even if it is an internet cliché destined to look dumb and dated as soon as the paint dries). Much as I would like to prohibit your sister from meme-ing up her garage and instead commit to the practical beauty of painting your kitchen, I cannot. She has chosen her side of the vale of income inequality, alas.

Title: Women Rule the New York City Wine & Food Festival - The New York Times

By Florence Fabricant

This is the 11th year for the New York City Wine & Food Festival, held from Oct. 11 to 14 and benefiting No Kid Hungry and the Food Bank for New York City. The events — around 80 dinners, brunches, demos, book signings, cooking classes and entertainment — will take place throughout the city, in restaurants, on Hudson River piers and elsewhere. As in the past, there are several first-time events: “Supper Is Served,” a walk-around tasting of food by female chefs, including Alex Guarnaschelli, Giada De Laurentiis and others, Oct. 11 on Pier 92, $150; and a panel discussion led by Andrew Zimmern about immigration and the hospitality industry, Oct. 12 on Pier 94 at the Hudson River, free but reservations required.

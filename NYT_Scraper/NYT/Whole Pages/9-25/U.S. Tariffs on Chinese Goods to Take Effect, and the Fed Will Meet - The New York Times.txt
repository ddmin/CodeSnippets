Title: U.S. Tariffs on Chinese Goods to Take Effect, and the Fed Will Meet - The New York Times

By The New York Times

Here’s what to expect in the week ahead:

ECONOMY

Tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports are due to take effect on Monday as the Trump administration moves ahead with its threats to punish China for its unwillingness to lower its trade barriers. The tariffs will hit a wide array of consumer goods and will initially be levied at a rate of 10 percent. At the end of the year, if no progress is made in negotiations, the rate will rise to 25 percent. China has promised to retaliate against the latest tariffs with new duties on American products.

Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, will meet on Tuesday in New York with Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, to continue discussions about a deal to reduce tensions and eliminate barriers to trans-Atlantic commerce. The talks began this summer with a mandate to cut tariffs to zero as part of a broad free-trade pact, but negotiators appear to have scaled back their ambitions and will concentrate first on eliminating regulatory barriers that create unnecessary costs for exporters. They could agree, for example, that drugs approved in the United States would automatically be approved for sale in the European Union and vice versa.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the fourth consecutive quarter. The benchmark rate, which the Fed is holding in a range between 1.75 and 2 percent, is still low enough to provide a mild dose of stimulus. As the economy keeps growing, and unemployment remains low, Fed officials want to limit inflation by raising the rate back up to a neutral level, and perhaps a little higher. Markets have already priced in a quarter-point increase on Wednesday, and investors see the odds of another quarter-point increase in December as better than 90 percent. The looming questions are about 2019. The Fed on Wednesday will also publish a new set of economic forecasts by the members of its policymaking committee, including their predictions about the course of monetary policy in the coming year.

Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, will take questions on Thursday at an event in Washington sponsored by The Hill newspaper. Mr. Mnuchin has maintained a low profile in recent weeks as the Trump administration’s trade war with China has escalated despite his efforts to restart talks. The event will offer the Treasury secretary an opportunity to explain the state of play with China as Mr. Trump’s latest round of tariffs on Chinese imports takes effect.

ECONOMY

Trade tensions are heating back up, with President Trump announcing a new round of tariffs on China, and China responding in kind. Data on trade and manufacturing from the Commerce Department on Thursday will help show whether the budding trade war has begun to damage the broader economy. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch mostly expect the answer to be “no.” They expect preliminary trade data to show that the trade deficit narrowed slightly in August as exports rebounded from a summer slowdown, and they forecast a modest uptick in orders for durable goods, in part because of strong demand for cars and parts. But a significant slowdown in either category will be taken as evidence that tariffs are beginning to act as a drag on economic growth.

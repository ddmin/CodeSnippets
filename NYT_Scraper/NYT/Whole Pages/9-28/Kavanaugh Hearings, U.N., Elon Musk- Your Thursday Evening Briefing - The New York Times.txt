Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. Political history unfolded in real time on television and computer screens across the country.

Christine Blasey Ford, the first woman who accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, described the terror she felt more than 30 years ago, when, she said, Mr. Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, tried to rip her clothes off and clapped his hand over her mouth to muffle her cries for help.

She remained steadfast in her account at a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying she was “100 percent” certain her assailant was Judge Kavanaugh, now a Supreme Court nominee.

“I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives,” she said. “Those who say that do not know me. I am a fiercely independent person, and I am no one’s pawn.”

_____

2. Taking the stand shortly after 3 p.m., Judge Brett Kavanaugh struck a markedly different tone.

At turns indignant and emotional, he defiantly refuted the allegations, accusing Democrats of acting in bad faith: “You have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy.”

We watched the hearings with people across the country, and you can find our full coverage here.

And our Opinion writers, who operate independently from the newsroom, had quite a bit to say.

_____

3. It may be hard to believe, but there were other things going on Thursday.

At the U.N., the world leaders speaking in New York included the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Our briefing on the General Assembly has the highlights, and you can watch speeches here.

The briefing also covers the appearance of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, above, at the U.N. Security Council, where he warned that sanctions against North Korea must remain in place.

In Geneva, the U.N. Human Rights Council voted to gather and analyze evidence of war crimes against Rohingya Muslims, one of its strongest moves to date on the conflict.

And President Trump’s meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has been delayed until next week.

_____

4. The S.E.C. sued Elon Musk, accusing him of making false public statements with the potential to hurt investors.

The suit relates to a tweet last month in which Mr. Musk, the C.E.O. of Tesla, said he was considering taking the company private. The S.E.C. is seeking to bar Mr. Musk from serving as an executive or director of publicly traded companies. (Tesla is one such company.)

The company’s shares quickly dropped more than 10 percent in after-hours trading.

_____

5. $19 an hour. 

Over the next five years, as many as 40,000 airport workers in the New York metro area will see their minimum wage rise to at least that.

It’s the highest minimum wage target set by any public agency in the country.

The board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs three of the country’s busiest airports, made the change after several months of deliberation — and years of pleading and pressure from unionized airport workers.

_____

6. Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, meets with House Republicans on Friday to discuss complaints that the company is trying to silence conservative voices.

That will serve as something of a corrective.

A few weeks ago, executives from Twitter and Facebook testified at Senate hearings. Google executives were invited — but didn’t attend.

That snub was the “worst business decision of 2018,” one analyst told us, adding, “They’ve sort of poked the bear.”

_____

7. Inside a life destroyed by C.T.E.

Daniel Te’o-Nesheim played in the N.F.L. for four seasons. He died at age 30, and later, chronic traumatic encephalopathy was diagnosed.

The trail of documents, letters, text messages, photographs and voice messages he left behind provides a vivid and heartbreaking, though incomplete, picture of a football player who in his last years began to display C.T.E.’s now familiar symptoms — including paranoia, disorientation, memory lapses and angry outbursts.

_____

8. Britain is facing a child poverty crisis.

In the past six years, the number of children living in poverty in Britain has jumped drastically. About a third of British minors will be poor by 2021, some forecasts say.

Before the 2008 financial crisis, successive British governments had reduced by 800,000 the number of minors living in “relative poverty.” Much of that progress has been wiped out as the Conservative-led government has slashed welfare benefits.

_____

9. France’s new law against catcalling got its first conviction when a court fined a man for lewd comments he made to a woman aboard a bus.

The panel of judges in the case also sentenced the man to nine months in jail — six months of it suspended — for physically assaulting the woman and the driver of the bus.

_____

10. Finally, it’s been a long day.

It could be a good time to pick up one of the 10 books our editors recommend this week, or check out our Cooking guide with tips on the sheet-pan dinner — designed to be delicious and simple without a lot of effort.

Have a wonderful evening.

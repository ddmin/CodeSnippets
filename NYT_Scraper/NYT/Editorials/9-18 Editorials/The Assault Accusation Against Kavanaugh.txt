Re “Accuser Goes Public, in Risk to Kavanaugh” (front page, Sept. 17):

The issue with respect to Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination is not whether while in high school he drunkenly attacked his accuser. Such behavior, having taken place at the age of 17, while totally inappropriate, is hardly disqualifying to his nomination to the Supreme Court. (Justice Hugo Black acknowledged during his confirmation hearings that he had as a young man been a member of the Ku Klux Klan.)

The fact that the accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, told her therapist about the incident lends credence to it. She had no reason six years ago to fabricate a story. Judge Kavanaugh’s denial of the incident is, however, much more troubling. It rather strains credibility that he forgot what he did.

Thus, rather than having the integrity to acknowledge a teenage misdeed, deplore it and use it as a teaching event for the country, and teenagers especially, he has added to his misconduct by, in effect, calling his accuser untruthful.

Judges come in all shapes and sizes, and all political stripes. But the one element we require of them is integrity.

This new information about Brett Kavanaugh’s alleged attempted sexual assault is important and must be investigated before a vote on his confirmation takes place. I’ll admit that even I thought, good heavens, it was so long ago and he was a kid. But then I acknowledged that my own escape from an attempted sexual assault my first year of college still leaves me traumatized at age 68.

And I know in my bones that the boy who tried to rape me can’t have grown into a good man. Because a good man can’t ever have been a boy who thought that overpowering a girl because he could was his due. The fact is, bullies are always bullies, even if they grow up and go underground. There is no way I’d want to see that boy given a lifelong appointment to wield power over others.

To the Editor:

There are many reasons to be concerned about the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh for a position on the Supreme Court, but something he may have done as an intoxicated 17-year-old at a party with his classmates isn’t one of them. Indeed, the very body on which Judge Kavanaugh would serve, if confirmed, has ruled repeatedly during the past 13 years that people under the age of 18 should not be held to the same standards of criminal responsibility as adults, because teenagers are impulsive, susceptible to peer influence and still capable of change. 

Few of us would want to be judged in adulthood on the basis of isolated incidents in which we were involved (or accused of having been involved) as teenagers. I sure wouldn’t.

To the Editor:

Do I have this right? A president credibly accused of sexual assault has nominated a judge accused of sexual assault to the Supreme Court, where he would join a justice accused of sexual harassment? Remind me again which is supposedly the party of faith and family values?

To the Editor:

If Brett Kavanaugh was as drunk as Christine Blasey Ford says he was when she claims he attacked her, it is likely he does not remember the incident and his denial is an honest statement. His drunkenness, if true, is not an excuse for his behavior but may explain his denial.

To the Editor:

Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard. Without minimizing the alleged crime or its impact, I’m not sure any 53-year-old is morally responsible for acts committed as a teenager, or that a 53-year-old is even the same person. But I am sure that there is no excuse for rushing Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation and withholding records. What else don’t we know about him?

If Dr. Blasey’s courage in stepping forward stops this rush and allows us to learn more about Judge Kavanaugh’s views, that is good for our democracy.

To the Editor:

I have some advice for Christine Blasey Ford: Stay home. Don’t testify before the Judiciary Committee if you value your sanity.

Just remember what happened to Anita Hill and the vile attacks on her by the Republicans. They have no integrity. You will put your reputation at risk from those predators who will stop at nothing to get their way.

To the Editor:

Because Christine Blasey Ford indicated that Brett Kavanaugh was drunk at the time of the alleged assault and attempted rape, there is a good possibility that he has no memory of the incident. Then whom do we believe, the victim, or a man who swears he did not do it, yet most likely was so impaired that he has no memory of his actions? And if he was impaired, does that mean because he acts “honorably” when sober he gets a pass when drunk?

To the Editor:

It may be insensitive of me, but I’m far more concerned about what Judge Brett Kavanaugh did in his years with Kenneth Starr, his time in the George W. Bush White House, and his opinions on the court of appeals than I am about what he is alleged to have done when he was 17. On the basis of his legal work he would be a disaster on the Supreme Court and should not be confirmed. However, if the standard by which we judge grown men and, yes, grown women is what they did when they were 17, it is a very thin reed on which to hang a vote.

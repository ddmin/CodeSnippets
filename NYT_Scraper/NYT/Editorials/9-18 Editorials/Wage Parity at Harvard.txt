Title: Wage Parity at Harvard

Subtitle: A retired union president tells the story of how it came to be.


To the Editor:

“It Pays to Work at Harvard” (Sunday Business, Sept. 9) properly recognizes the contribution of student activists who in 2001 took over Harvard’s administration building demanding more for campus workers.

To its credit, the university studied the issue and adopted a new policy mandating that service-job subcontractors pay what Harvard pays employees in comparable jobs.

The missing piece from this article is the role played by the Harvard service unions Unite Here Local 26 and the Service Employees Local 32BJ.

Before 2001, Unite Here Local 26 had already negotiated wage parity between dining hall workers and employees of Harvard’s largest food service subcontractor.

Martha Bonilla, an employee of that subcontractor, makes more than $25 an hour because dining hall workers in Unite Here Local 26 struggled for decades to improve their compensation, including a 22-day strike in 2016. 

Because of Harvard’s parity policy, food-service subcontractors had no choice but to match union wages. Subcontracted janitors start at $22.69 because of S.E.I.U.'s work.

Without unions, pay for Harvard workers would be much lower, and thus parity for subcontracted workers would result in lower wages.

When workers have a voice, institutions can do great things.

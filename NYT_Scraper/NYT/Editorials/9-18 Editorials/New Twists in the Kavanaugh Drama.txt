Title: New Twists in the Kavanaugh Drama

Subtitle: Readers continue the debate over whether an alleged sexual assault as a teenager should disqualify a Supreme Court nominee.

Re “Court Pick and Accuser Set for Public Hearings on Sex Assault Claim” (front page, Sept. 18):

The attempt by the Senate Judiciary Committee to try Judge Brett Kavanaugh in the court of public opinion via televised hearings is a mistake. It invites grandstanding by some politicians and is unfair to all parties concerned. The Federal Bureau of Investigation should investigate these allegations and bring its findings to the committee, where a closed-door hearing should be held.

Not only will there be no legal proof at a public hearing of this sort (more like he said/she said), but we have already seen how the senators who may be running for president in 2020 behave at televised hearings. Two people’s futures are at stake here, and I, for one, would not like to allow the Senate Judiciary Committee to be the arbiter of their lives.

This situation should not be politicized any more than it already has been. Just another three-ring circus in the Senate. The senators have other things they should be doing.

Attempted rape has long, destructive and painful consequences for many victims. Those who have described what Christine Blasey Ford accuses Brett Kavanaugh of doing as teenage misconduct forgot to ask: How would I have described this act had it been inflicted upon my own 15-year-old daughter?

Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser has passed a polygraph test administered by a retired F.B.I. agent. If I were Judge Kavanaugh, and I knew I was innocent, I’d be jumping up and down, waving my arms to take one as well. He speaks volumes by not offering to take the test.

To the Editor:

Several letter writers (“Assault Accusation Against Kavanaugh,” Sept. 18) mention that Judge Brett Kavanaugh might be telling the truth when he says that he does not remember the alleged incident because he was drunk. There is another reason a man might not remember such an incident. For the guys, it is often experienced as mere play, fooling around or a lark. What fun! What a great story to tell the other guys!

For the girl who is pinned down and at the mercy of the stronger male’s behavior, the event is frightening and traumatic. The guys have all the control; she has by far the most to lose. It is no wonder that women can often recall the experience in minute detail while the men struggle to remember if there even was an event.

To the Editor:

The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is grousing that this new charge against Brett Kavanaugh was brought up in an “irregular manner.” “Irregular manner” doesn’t come even close to describing what he did to Merrick Garland when the last seat on the court opened up.

To the Editor:

Judge Brett Kavanaugh should not be confirmed for the appointment to the highest court in the land. This is a perfect opportunity to teach all teenage boys and young men that actions have consequences and behavior in their youthful years may someday come back to haunt them in their ambitions.

To the Editor:

Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate: Confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh at your peril. Women who vote in November will remember what you have done if you vote to place him on the Supreme Court, after his reprehensible behavior on a bed — no matter that it was years ago.

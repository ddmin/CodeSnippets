Title: Today’s New York News: New Yorkers on #WhyIDidntReport - The New York Times

By Adriana Balsamo

Good morning on this stormy Friday.

“Because he told me I would get in trouble.”

“Because I thought that’s just what happens when you drink too much.”

“I was in the 2nd grade. It was my first time wearing a skirt.”

Those are just a few of the responses that can be found on more than 1,000 fliers posted around Manhattan and Brooklyn on subway platforms, bathroom walls, lamp posts and more. The fliers, with the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport, asked New Yorkers to share their stories of sexual assault and why they didn’t report them.

Ha Jung Song and Bowook Yoon, students at the School of Visual Arts, said they came up with the idea in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and after reading tweets from President Trump in which he was “blaming victims for not reporting to police” their accounts, Ms. Song said.

The two thought, “What if we could make a template for people who hadn’t yet shared their stories?” she said.

So they posted fliers with a prompt: Take a photo of this template and share your #WhyIDidntReport stories via Instagram. Some passers-by shared their stories on social media; others opted to write about their accounts on the fliers anonymously.

At first their professor, Thomas Shim, was hesitant about the project.

He told them don’t do it for the attention or the likes. “I wanted them to make something that was authentic,” he said.

The students persuaded him that their project was genuine and they got the green light.

Ms. Song and Mr. Yoon plan to put up posters in all five boroughs. Today, from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m., there will be an oversize poster in Union Square Park on which people can write their stories. (The rain date is tomorrow, at the same time.)

“We are planning to keep this going,” Ms. Song said. “We want to push this — not blame victims — and continue to hear them out.”

Here’s what else is happening:

Fabulous fall weather is up ahead.

But first, we have to get though this wet morning commute. Thunderstorms are in the forecast until noon and the rain could be heavy at times. Today’s high is 64.

We’ll be singing the skies’ praises this weekend: Sunny with highs in the low 70s.

Giving Directions

Dear Diary:

I had a job at one of the retail kiosks at Grand Central Terminal that sold jewelry. Passers-by often asked where certain places were or where to find the subway, so I got used to giving directions.

On one occasion, a woman approached just as a small group was at the kiosk examining the jewelry.

“Excuse me,” she said. “Wasn’t there a coffee shop right here?”

“Yes,” I said. “But it got removed. I’m sorry. There is one not too far from here though.”

“Oh, shoot,” she said. “You have customers.”

I assured her that it was no problem and proceeded to give her directions to the coffee shop.

“Thank you so much,” she said, hurrying off while I turned my attention to other people at the kiosk.

About 10 minutes later, I was helping someone when I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was the woman I’d just given directions to.

“This is for you,” she said, placing a small orange envelope in my hand. In neat handwriting, it said, “Thank you for directing me!”

Inside was a gift certificate to the coffee shop I had directed her to. Before I could speak, she was gone.

I still keep that little orange envelope on my desk.

Have you had trouble finding a CitiBike recently?

Well, you’re not alone.

About 21 percent of the fleet has recently disappeared, according to StreetsBlog NYC.

On Wednesday, CitiBike members (us included) we’re sent an email.

“We’ve recently seen unusual damage on some of our handlebars, and out of an abundance of caution we’ve removed a part of our fleet from service,” CitiBike explained. “We are working to retrofit this part of the fleet with the new handlebar design that we introduced this summer.”

CitiBike didn’t specify the issue with the handlebars, but some users have complained on Twitter of handlebars that folded down or handle grips that slip off the handlebars.

It’s still uncertain when bike levels will be back to normal, but CitiBike wrote that it is devoting extra resources to the issue, and “you will see an improvement in bike availability soon.”

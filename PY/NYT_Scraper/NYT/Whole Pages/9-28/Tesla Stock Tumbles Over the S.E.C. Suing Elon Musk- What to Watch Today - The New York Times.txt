Tesla shares are set to tumble on the news that the Securities and Exchange Commission has sued Elon Musk over statements he made about taking the company private.

Back story:  Mr. Musk shocked Wall Street this summer when he tweeted about plans to remove the company from the public stock markets and claimed to have “funding secured.” Tesla stock soared on the news. But Mr. Musk eventually called off the take-private bid.

The news:  The S.E.C. said that Mr. Musk “knew or was reckless in not knowing” that his statements were false or misleading. The regulator seeks to bar Mr. Musk from serving as an executive or director of a publicly traded company, one of the toughest possible penalties for a corporate officer and a serious blow for Tesla. (Mr. Musk reportedly turned down the possibility of a settlement.)

What to watch: Tesla shares are down over 12 percent in premarket trading on Friday. Investors betting against Tesla’s shares — a thorn in Mr. Musk’s side — are likely to make even bigger profits on their wagers. In the longer term, the legal challenge could make it harder for Mr. Musk’s private companies, SpaceX and The Boring Company, to secure investment.

Google’s C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, will meet with Republican lawmakers. He is expected to discuss the company’s work in China, its market dominance and allegations of political bias in its search results.

Title: California Today: Introducing Our New Correspondent - The New York Times

By The New York Times

Good morning.

(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)

We’re starting off the week with some news of our own. Here’s a note from Marc Lacey, The Times’s National editor, and Julie Bloom, a deputy National editor who oversees California Today.

We’re thrilled to announce that we’ve selected the next correspondent for California Today. Jill Cowan, who has reported up and down the Golden State, will be joining us in November.

A U.C. Berkeley graduate, Jill has worked at The Bakersfield Californian, The Los Angeles Times and The Daily Pilot. She joins us from The Dallas Morning News, where she covers the economy of a state second only to California in gross domestic product. A member of the Asian American Journalists Association, she is now on a fellowship in Japan, where her mother was born.

A bit about Jill, in her own words:

“I tweeted from protests on the U.C. Berkeley campus when I was in college. I spent a Thanksgiving night at a Walmart parking lot in Bakersfield for the Black Friday rush. I tracked down family members walking the rocky banks of the Kern River looking for a corrections officer that had disappeared in the rapids, and I checked on Legoland during the wildfires that ripped through San Diego County in 2014. I wrote about the boycott of a Newport Beach Christmas Boat Parade. When an Asiana Airlines flight crashed at SFO, I spent the day camped out at San Francisco General Hospital — not yet named for Mark Zuckerberg.

“But none of that explains why I love the Golden State.

“Nominally, I’m a Giants fan, but I don’t know if I’ve ever been as content as I used to be on the bleachers at Sam Lynn Ballpark, sweat pouring down my back as I watched the (now-defunct) Bakersfield Blaze play against a backdrop of the setting sun.

“Food-wise, I’ve spent much of my adult life in failed pursuit of a salad that approaches the majesty and baffling affordability of the ones I could get at Cafe Intermezzo in Berkeley.

“Jonathan Gold was right about Bakersfield’s dining scene. But my favorite place in the world is King’s Hawaiian Bakery in Torrance, where my grandparents used to take us for breakfast whenever we’d visit. Ask to sit by the tropical fish tank.”

Jill’s turf on California Today will be broad. Expect to see her weighing in on issues large and small, in communities large and small across a state that fascinates our readers. With Jill at its helm, California Today will bring even more attention to important issues like climate change, immigration and technology, and to big stories, from natural disasters to politics. She will no doubt share a meal or two with Tejal Rao, The Times’s new California restaurant critic.

In just two years, California Today has become a must read in the morning for hundreds of thousands of subscribers, with its roundup of news and lively reported features. It builds on the work of the dozens of journalists we have around the state and is part of a broader focus on California by The New York Times.

Nite Yun, 36, still doesn’t know how her parents met — nor does she have any memories of the refugee camp in Thailand where she was born.

Her main point of access to her family’s history was what she ate in Stockton, where her parents eventually settled after fleeing the violence of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. And now Ms. Yun has drawn on her childhood in Stockton to open Nyum Bai in Oakland, where it has attracted national attention.

“These are the dishes that my mom would cook from her memory,” Ms. Yun said of her menu. “These are the ways the Khmer still have recipes.”

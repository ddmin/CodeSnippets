Title: Tell Us Your Love Story. Just Keep It Really Short.  - The New York Times

By Daniel Jones

What kind of love story can you share in two tweets, an Instagram caption or a Facebook post? The Modern Love team wants to find out. Tell us a love story from your own life — happy or sad, capturing a moment or a lifetime — in 100 words or fewer. Include a picture taken by you that complements your narrative, whether a selfie, screenshot or snapshot. We plan to publish the most funny and heart-wrenching entries we receive. We’re calling them Tiny Love Stories. They are about as long as this paragraph. They must be true. Share yours today.

Title: Opinion | Democracy Forges Ahead - The New York Times

By Serge Schmemann

ATHENS — “Democracies are like angry dragons,” said Kishore Mahbubani, a professor of public policy in Singapore, expressing what emerged, in effect, as the theme of the Athens Democracy Forum here last week convened by The New York Times, the city of Athens and the United Nations. Speaker after speaker talked in fearful terms of the challenges to liberal democracy posed by a widespread backlash to migrants, globalization, social change and other tectonic movements many have found threatening.

Radoslaw Sikorski, a former defense and foreign minister of Poland, declared that between the minute scrutiny of social media and the election in some countries of autocrats, “in Western society leadership is becoming impossible.” The names of President Trump, Jaroslaw Kaszynski of Poland and Viktor Orban of Hungary were often invoked, and the word “fascism” was uttered more than once.

Yet just as the dragon is also a symbol of strength and excellence, there are solutions to the problems, speakers said: in the rule of law, in technology giants’ learning to better manage their great power and reach, in the diversity of new generations, in more socially conscious businesses.

Democracy is not at a dead end, was a consensus that emerged — though as Professor Mahbubani said, it needs constant attention. The United States is not Trump, Poland is not Kaczynski and Hungary is not Orban, said Karolina Wigura of Poland’s Kultura Liberalna think tank; even in China, said Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist and activist, change could come at any moment. Dragons, hold your fire.

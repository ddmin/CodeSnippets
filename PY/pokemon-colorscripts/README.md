# Pokemon colorscripts

## Very Hacky Fork
Can't specify form of pokemon. Instead it just chooses a random form if the pokemon has any alternate forms.
This was done in order to work with ```pokemon-colorscripts -r``` (because the alternate forms were lonely).

- All the pokemon designs, names, branding etc. are trademarks of [The Pokémon Company](https://pokemon.com)
- The box art sprites were taken from the amazing [PokéSprite](https://msikma.github.io/pokesprite/) database
